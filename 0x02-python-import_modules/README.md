unveiling the Python Mysteries

In this captivating journey, I delved into the realms of Python's magicâ€”learning the art of importing, crafting modules, and mastering the orchestration of code. The secrets of `dir()` unfurled before me, and I danced with the symphony of command-line arguments within Python scripts.

## Tasks ðŸ“œ

**Task 0: Unleashing the Elixir of Addition**
* [0-add.py](./0-add.py): I summoned the power of addition from the scroll [add_0.py](./add_0.py) and chanted the enchantment `1 + 2 = 3`.
* Outcome: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>` echoed through the air.

**Task 1: Crafting My First Toolbox**
* [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py): The arcane tomes [calculator_1.py](./1-calculator.py) surrendered their secrets, unveiling the results of additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions between `10` and `5`.
* Outcome: `<a value> <operator> <b value> = <operation(a, b) value>` resonated with magic.

**Task 2: Unveiling Script's True Form**
* [2-args.py](./2-args.py): I invoked the incantation, displaying the number and the chronicles of arguments that graced my script.
* Outcome: `[Number of arguments] argument` or `arguments`, followed by a mystical display of each argument's journey.

**Task 3: The Dance of Infinite Addition**
* [3-infinite_add.py](./3-infinite_add.py): I wove a spell to summon the essence of numbers, culminating in the ethereal sum of their harmonies.
* Outcome: The sum of the arguments, resonating through the very fabric of reality.

**Task 4: Gazing into the Hidden Mirrors**
* [4-hidden_discovery.py](./4-hidden_discovery.py): The hidden enclaves of `hidden_4.pyc` revealed their cryptic names, a tapestry woven in alphabetical elegance.
* Outcome: A cascade of names, omitting those who begin with `__`, enchanting the realm.

**Task 5: Importing the Essence**
* [5-variable_load.py](./5-variable_load.py): The essence of `a` from [variable_load_5.py](./variable_load_5.py) flowed through my script, revealing its truth.
* Outcome: The essence of `a`, whispered from across dimensions.

**Task 6: Forging My Calculator**
* [100-my_calculator.py](./100-my_calculator.py): I raised my wand to summon the powers of [calculator_1.py](./calculator_1.py), constructing a magical calculator to weave spells of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Usage: `./100-my_calculator.py <a> <operator> <b>` painted the canvas of reality.
* Outcome: `<a> <operator> <b> = <result>` echoed with power, or `Unknown operator. Available operators: +, -, *, and /` for unknowable runes.

**Task 7: Whisper of Easiness**
* [101-easy_print.py](./101-easy_print.py): The incantation `#pythoniscool` flowed freely, painted upon the canvas of reality without traditional tools.
* Outcome: `#pythoniscool`, a whisper from the heart of magic.

**Task 8: The Dance of Bytecode**
* [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py): The intricate dance of bytecode and logic in [magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py) was embraced, resonating with Holberton's magic.
* Outcome: A spell to match a specific bytecode, a harmony between code and the arcane.

**Task 9: The Swiftness of Alphabet**
* [103-fast_alphabet.py](./103-fast_alphabet.py): Without loops or explicit literals, the alphabet unfolded in uppercase, a swift breeze of magic.
* Outcome: The alphabet, grand and majestic, whispered in uppercase symphony.
